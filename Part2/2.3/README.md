## Part 2.3

For the sake of clarity I didn't want to mess this repository with anything else than docker or docker-compose related stuff. Usually I would place Dockerfiles in the root of an application rather than use aberrant file naming like Dockerfile-frontend etc...

If you want to see the frontend and backend in action, install them by running `(git clone https://github.com/docker-hy/backend-example-docker.git backend && cd backend && npm install) && (git clone https://github.com/docker-hy/frontend-example-docker.git frontend && cd frontend && npm install)` and run `docker-compose up`
